# 🎮 Sensor-Powered Interactive Games

Welcome to **Sensor-Powered Interactive Games**, an experimental and playful collection of mini-games that blend the physical and digital worlds using motion-based inputs.  
This project explores innovative ways of replacing traditional keyboard/mouse/gamepad interactions with body gestures and sensor data, opening new possibilities for accessible and immersive experiences.

## 🕹️ Included Games

- **Pong**  
  The iconic two-player paddle game, redesigned for motion sensor control. Players move paddles by performing specific gestures or movements, introducing a dynamic and engaging twist to the classic arcade experience.

- **Tic-Tac-Toe (Triqui)**  
  A reimagining of the traditional three-in-a-row game. Instead of clicking or tapping, players select cells and place their marks using intuitive motion commands, making strategy games even more interactive.

- **Slot Machine**  
  A colorful, lively slot machine game where spins are activated through motion inputs. Experience the thrill of the casino with a wave of your hand!

## ⚙️ Technical Details

- **Input System**: Sensor-based gesture detection (customizable per hardware).
- **Architecture**: Fully modular, making it easy to expand with new games or adapt to different input devices (e.g., webcams, IR sensors, Kinect, Leap Motion).
- **Performance**: Designed for fast response times to ensure fluid and natural interaction even on modest hardware.
- **Extensibility**: Each game is structured as an independent module, allowing developers to add, remove, or modify games without impacting the core system.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- **Explore new interaction paradigms**: Move beyond keyboards and mice to create more natural gaming experiences.
- **Enhance accessibility**: Make games that can be played by a wider audience, including those with limited access to traditional controllers.
- **Prototype creative ideas**: Serve as a sandbox for experimenting with sensor-driven gameplay mechanics.
- **Encourage modular development**: Allow easy adaptation to new sensors and gaming concepts.
